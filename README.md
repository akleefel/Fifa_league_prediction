# Fifa_league_prediction


### Overview

In this project I used data from Kaggle's "Fifa '18 More Complete Data Set" and used machine learning to predict league affiliation of players based on their physical attributes. Here, the idea was to see if there are underlying differences in the physical and skill attributes of players in different leagues that allow for a classification.

For simplicity, I focused on the first and second tear of Europe's largest football countries (i.e. England, Italy, Spain, France, and Germany). This way, the data set was filtered down to 5314 players and 166 attributes. After some model and feature selection, the best model (Support Vector Machine) achieved a classification accuracy of approximately 34%.

*Note:*  As soon as I find the time, I will re-run this analysis considering only players from top-tear leagues.
